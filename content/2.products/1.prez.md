[Prez](https://github.com/rdflib/prez/) is an open source, data-configurable, Linked Data API framework that delivers _profiles_ of Knowledge Graph data according to the Content Negotiation by Profile standard.

We use Prez to deliver thematic views of data stored in Knowledge Graphs, for example, for the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq), we support an instance of Prez configured to deliver business and scientific _vocabularies_, that is controlled lists of terms available in human- and machine-readable form.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
We deployed Prez for GSQ in 2019 to present a small number of scientific vocabularies that they were developing, such as [Sample Preparation Methods](http://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-preparation-methods).

Finding Prez easy to use, GSQ then characterised some of their administrative vocabularies, such as [Transaction Status](https://vocabs.gsq.digital/object?uri=http://linked.data.gov.au/def/transaction-status) and presented them via Prez too.

GSQ continues to use Prez (see [all their vocabs](https://vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/)) and are currently establishing a reference spatial dataset - the _Geological Features of Queensland_ which they will soon deliver as spatial data via Prez also.

For GSQ, Prez is easy to use, long-term reliable, and easily expandable for more classes of data.

### We provide these services for Prez:

<ins>Modes</ins>

- **shared instance**
  - we host a single shared KurrawongAI Prez instance available for use when you only have a few vocabularies to add
- **hosted instance**
  - we can host and manage a Prez instance on your behalf
- **deployed instance**
  - we can deploy your own instance, within your own infrastructure
    
    _for example: on-prem or in the cloud (Azure, AWS, OpenStack)_

<ins>Support</ins>

For any of the above modes:

- **theming**
  - Prez is designed to be re-branded to match your organisation's needs and we can do that
  - see some branded instances: [OGC](http://defs.opengis.net/vocprez/vocab/), [GSSA](https://gssa-prez-linux-web-app.azurewebsites.net/vocab)
- **configuration**
  - we can create custom profiles of data you deliver via Prez
  - we can also create RESTful endpoints for stored queries
- **data creation**
  - we can build data for your Prez instances from non-Knowledge Graph data

    _for example: Excel files into vocabularies, File GeoDatabases into spatial Knowledge Graph data_
- **operations**
  - for deployed instances, we can work with your staff to ensure it's running nicely
- **training**
  - we can train your staff to operate Prez
  - we can train your staff in the creation of your own data, custom profiles in Prez etc.
- **interoperability**
  - we can make your existing, or new, external systems work with Prez
  - Prez has a couple of standard APIs and we can work with those but it can also have new APIs and endpoints added
- **extension**
  - we wrote most of the Prez code so can extend it if needed!

Please see the [KurrawongAI Docs page for Prez](https://docs.kurrawong.ai/products/prez/) for use and developer documentation.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) produces [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) renditions of many of their standards' codelists which are published for them by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) as part of a reference data Knowledge Graph known as the [Rainbow](https://defs.opengis.net/prez), which is an instance of Prez.

[Technical Committee 211](https://www.iso.org/committee/54904.html) uses [prezmanifest](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/cmd/prezmanifest), our RDF data management application, to synchronise changes they make to their may codelists with the OGC's Rainbow.

This is easy for the ISO because _prezmanifest_ containes automated validation and documentation tools.

This is efficient for the OGC because _prezmanifest_ can synchronise parts of a Knowledge Graph with source data, without affecting unrelated parts.

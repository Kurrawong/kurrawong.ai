# kurra

kurra is an open source toolkit for the management of RDF data. It provides a range of functions to validate, convert, export and load [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) data and aims to assist with many of the common tasks that RDF users encounter.

kurra is built on [RDFLib](https://rdflib.dev) which is an open source, low-level, RDF manipulation tool maintained by an international consortium of software experts and which KurrawongAI contributes to.

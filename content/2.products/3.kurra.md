# kurra

kurra is an open source toolkit for the management of RDF data. It provides a range of functions to validate, convert, export and load [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) data and aims to assist with many of the common tasks that RDF users encounter.

kurra is built on [RDFLib](https://rdflib.dev) which is an open source, low-level, RDF manipulation tool maintained by an international consortium of software experts and which KurrawongAI contributes to.

See the tool's detailed documentation at:

The [Geological Survey of Western Australia (GSWA)](https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-mines-petroleum-and-exploration/geological-survey-of-western-australia) produces large amounts of RDF data from a number of siloed databases, files stores and other data locations which are merged into a single RDF Knowledge Graph. 

They use _kurra_ both manually and within workflows and scripts to validate and load their RDF datasets into the Knowledge Graph which is stored in an instance of [Fuseki](/products/fuseki).

_kurra_ helps GSWA to maintain multiple RDF generation scripts and workflows by providing each with a large set of RDF manipulation functions that can select for use, without having to reinvent solutions to common problems.

This is efficient for _kurra_ is under active developments and is accumulating new features and processing efficiencies whcih they get "for free" by just upgrading their instnaces of _kurra_ at no cost.

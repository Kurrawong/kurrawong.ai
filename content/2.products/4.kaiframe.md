Knowledge Graphs are the secret behind some of the most successful search products. In the AI era, Knowledge Graphs provide the grounding of answers to factual information so you can have confidence in answers you receive.

KurrawongAI have been experts in Knowledge Graph technology for over a decade - probably longer than any other company based in Australia. We can link all of your information, whether it be from tables, databases or emails, to provide the foundation for expert AI systems.

Unstructured: We have ready to deploy solutions for information extraction from unstructured data, such as PDFs and Microsoft Office formats.

Structured: Our experience covers conventional machine learning methods - graph machine learning.

Data integration: we are experts in Knowledge Graph technology. We can extract all data and metadata into a single Knowledge Graph providing 360 degree visibility across all of your data - including spatial and temporal aspects.

Knowledge Graphs are inherently interoperable, you can move between Knowledge Graph providers with ease. We take the same approach to AI solutions, providing a framework where data is the key asset, allowing you to seamlessly switch between AI and Machine Learning models (or use multiple).

## System

KaiFrame comprises three core components:

1. KaiFlow
2. KaiGraph
3. KaiUI

KaiFrame uses workflows to process target content - which could be textual documents,
images, specialised data files - using selected AI tools and preserves detailed 
provenance of processing, for traceability.

### KaiFlow

KaiFlow is the KurrawongAI Data marshalling tools. It is used:

- to marshall data for AI processing,
- store processing results and provenance information, and
- for the ultimate delivery of search applications and data.

The KaiFlow tooling allows integration with many up-stream AI products, and can be
customised as each situation requires. For instance, KaiFlow has been deployed with
[Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
to process large numbers of text documents within Microsoft's Azure cloud.

### KaiGraph

KaiGraph is the standards compliant, domain [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)
that enables high value context curation for effecient and accurate LLM responses.

KaiGraph stores the results of processing, processing provenance and reference data
which guides the AI. This KG acts as both a catalogue of data and a database of
information within the catalogued objects.

### KaiUI

The AI centric UI can operate in stand-alone mode, or it can be embedded
within clients' preferred products, such as desktop software or web pages. We have
specialist UI elements for AI chat, spatial data viewing and data exploration.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
In 2024 - 2025, we developed and deployed an instance of _KaiFrame_ for a large international mining company. 

We used _KaiFrame_'s data marshalling and processing workflows to process thousands of datasets of mixed files, many of which contained spatial data files which we automatically extracted extent information from. We also processed close to 1/2 million domain documents, extracting text for chat UIs and images for specialised image processing.

The Knowledge Graph we implemented for this deployment contained specialised information about the company's target resources as well as general reference geological information which we know very well from national and international geological work, for example with the [Commission for Geoscience Information](https://cgi-iugs.org/) who's standardised vocabularies of controlled terms we've provided technical publication tools for, for years.

We then created both a stand-alone catalogue UI to KaiFrame's content, to allow for data management, and a chat search and data loading UI embedded within [ESRI's ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com) which the company's staff use every day.

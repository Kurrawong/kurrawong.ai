# KaiFrame

KaiFrame is the KurrawongAI AI framework. It is comprised of three core components:

1. KaiFlow
2. KaiGraph
3. KaiUI

KaiFrame uses workflows to process target content - which could be textual documents,
images, specialised data files - using selected AI tools and preserves detailed
provenance of processing, for traceability.

## KaiFlow

KaiFlow is the KurrawongAI Data marshalling tools. It is used:

- to marshall data for AI processing,
- store processing results and provenance information, and
- for the ultimate delivery of search applications and data.

The KaiFlow tooling allows integration with many up-stream AI products, and can be
customised as each situation requires. For instance, KaiFlow has been deployed with
[Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence)
to process large numbers of text documents within Microsoft's Azure cloud.

## KaiGraph

KaiGraph is the standards compliant, domain [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph)
that enables high value context curation for effecient and accurate LLM responses.

KaiGraph stores the results of processing, processing provenance and reference data
which guides the AI. This KG acts as both a catalogue of data and a database of
information within the catalogued objects.

## KaiUI

The AI centric UI can operate in stand-alone mode, or it can be embedded
within clients' preferred products, such as desktop software or web pages. We have
specialist UI elements for AI chat, spatial data viewing and data exploration.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
In 2024 - 2025, we developed and deployed an instance of _KaiFrame_ for a large
international mining company.

We used _KaiFrame_'s data marshalling and processing workflows to process thousands
of datasets of mixed files, many of which contained spatial data files which we
automatically extracted extent information from.

We also processed close to 1/2 million domain documents, extracting text for chat UIs
and images for specialised image processing.

The Knowledge Graph we implemented for this deployment contained specialised
information about the company's target resources as well as general reference
geological information which we know very well from national and international
geological work, for example with the [Commission for Geoscience Information](https://cgi-iugs.org/)
who's standardised vocabularies of controlled terms we've provided technical
publication tools for, for years.

We then created both a stand-alone catalogue UI to KaiFrame's content, to allow
for data management, and a chat search and data loading UI embedded within
[ESRI's ArcGIS Online](https://www.arcgis.com) which the company's staff use every day.

# KurraScope

**Leaders in Knowledge Graph technology**  
Knowledge Graphs are the secret behind some of the most successful search products. In the AI era, Knowledge Graphs provide the grounding of answers to factual information so you can have confidence in answers you receive. At Kurrawong we are experts in Knowledge Graph technology - we can link all of your information, whether it be from tables, databases or emails, to provide the foundation for expert AI systems.

**See where your answers are coming from**  
No need to blindly trust AI - see the full provenance of answers, based on your in-house private data.

**Phrase search across terabytes of data**  
Vector search algorithms are the technology behind modern Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows used with Large Language Models. We utilise best of breed solutions to provide sub second phrase searching across terabytes of data. 

**Search across all of your internal structured and unstructured information seamlessly.**  
Unstructured: We have ready to deploy solutions for information extraction from unstructured data, such as PDFs and Microsoft Office formats.
Structured: Our experience covers conventional machine learning methods - graph machine learning.
Data integration: we are experts in Knowledge Graph technology. We can extract all data and metadata into a single Knowledge Graph providing 360 degree visibility across all of your data - including spatial and temporal aspects.

**No lock in - take advantage of the latest AI and ML models as they are released**  
Knowledge Graphs are inherently interoperable, you can move between Knowledge Graph providers with ease. We take the same approach to AI solutions, providing a framework where data is the key asset, allowing you to seamlessly switch between AI and Machine Learning models (or use multiple).

**Data privacy**  
Data remains within Australia (or your chosen region), and is not utilised to train Large Language Models.

In 2024 - 2025, we developed and deployed an instance of _KurraScope_ for a large international mining company. 

We used _KurraScope_'s data marshalling and processing workflows to process thousands of datasets of mixed files, many of which contained spatial data files which we automatically extracted extent information from. We also processed close to 1/2 million domain documents, extracting text for chat UIs and images for specialised image processing.

The Knowledge Graph we implemented for this deployment contained specialised information about the company's target resources as well as general reference geological information which we know very well from national and international geological work, for example with the [Commission for Geoscience Information](https://cgi-iugs.org/) who's standardised vocabularies of controlled terms we've provided technical publication tools for, for years.

We then created both a stand-alone catalogue UI to KurraScope's content, to allow for data management, and a chat search and data loading UI embedded within [ESRI's ArcGIS Ontline](https://www.arcgis.com) which the company's staff use every day.

# KurraScope

KurraScope is our AI framework product.

KurraScope contains workflows and databases we use to marshall data for AI processing, to store the processing results and provenance of processing, and for the ultimate delivery of search applications and data.

We use a number of up-stream AI products within KurraScope and can customise deployments of it with new products, as each situation requires. For instance, we deploy KurraScope with [Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-document-intelligence) if a client wishes to process large numbers of text documents within Microsoft's Azure cloud.

KurraScope consists of 3 main parts:

1. Data marshalling and processing workflows
2. Domain Knowledge Graph
3. AI UI

KurraScope uses workflows to process target content - which could be textual documents, images, specialised data files - using selected AI tools and preserves detailed provenance of processing, for traceability.

Each KurraScope instance uses a [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) to store the results of processing, processing provenance and reference data which guides the AI. This KG acts as both a catalogue of data and a database of information within the catalogued objects.

The AI UI we implement can operate in stand-alone mode, or it can be embedded within clients' preferred products, such as desktop software or web pages. We have specialist UI elements for AI chat, spatial data viewing and data exploration.

In 2024 - 2025, we developed and deployed an instance of _KurraScope_ for a large international mining company. 

We used _KurraScope_'s data marshalling and processing workflows to process thousands of datasets of mixed files, many of which contained spatial data files which we automatically extracted extent information from. We also processed close to 1/2 million domain documents, extracting text for chat UIs and images for specialised image processing.

The Knowledge Graph we implemented for this deployment contained specialised information about the company's target resources as well as general reference geological information which we know very well from national and international geological work, for example with the [Commission for Geoscience Information](https://cgi-iugs.org/) who's standardised vocabularies of controlled terms we've provided technical publication tools for, for years.

We then created both a stand-alone catalogue UI to KurraScope's content, to allow for data management, and a chat search and data loading UI embedded within [ESRI's ArcGIS Ontline](https://www.arcgis.com) which the company's staff use every day.

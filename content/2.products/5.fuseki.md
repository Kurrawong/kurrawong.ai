[Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) free and open source product that is part of the [Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) RDF framework.

It is an [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) database which implements the [SPARQL Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) so it can be used to expose Knwoledge Graph information to applications.

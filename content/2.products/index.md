# Products

## Our Approach

KurrawongAI provides Knowledge Graph solutions architecture consulting and supports a range of products related to this, some of which are free open source software, some of which we have developed ourselves. We also recommend other parties' commercial products when they meet client needs: _we are not tied to any particular products!_

Our aim is to ensure that we provide you with the optimum solution, based on whichever product will best fit the needs of your organisation.

However, we actively support a range of Knowledge Graph-related products: mostly Free and Open Source RDF databases and tools.

## Supported Tools

Where KurrawongAI has developed tools through our work with RDF and Semantic Web technologies that we feel have value for the broader technology community, we do our best to share and maintain these. This includes several to which we provide access via an online user-interface for ease of use:
- **[PrezManifest](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/cmd/prezmanifest)** - a Python command line and workflow application that helps manage parts of Knowledge Graphs
- **[pyLODE](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/pylode)** - used to generate human-readable HTML documentation from ontologies
- **[RDF Converter](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/convert)** - convert between different RDF formats
- **[SHACL Validator](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/validate)** - Validate RDF data against SHACL rules
- **[VocExcel](https://tools.kurrawong.ai/tools/vocexcel)** - convert Excel data to SKOS vocabularies

In other instances, please see the relevant GitHub repositories:
- **[RDFrame](https://github.com/Kurrawong/rdframe-lib)**
- **[SPARQL parser](https://github.com/Kurrawong/sparql)**

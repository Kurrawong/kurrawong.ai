# Semantic Background

<img src="/img/logo-semback.png" alt="SemBack logo" style="width:35%"/>

The _Semantic Background_ is a Knowledge Graph that contains data models - ontologies - vocabularies, validators and example data used by KurrawongAI for many projects. It is accessible via several APIs.

The SB makes it easy to access many managed and harmonised reference resources at a single point.

## What's in it?

* 55 or so ontologies
* several hundred vocabularies
    * Australian biodiversity 
    * International & Australian mining sector
    * spatial data standards
* 13 SHACL validators
    * accessible via [kurra](/products/kurra)'s `shacl validate` function
* a few spatial datasets
    * GeoNames, as Linked Data
    * Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric, as Linked Data
    * ASGS, as Linked Data

## $$$?

Most of the Semantic Background is freely available either directly online or via tools such as [kurra](/products/kurra), however enhanced use of it can be arranged too. Such use may be for:

* housing and managing specialised reference data items
    * an organisation might wish us to manage reference data for them
* specialised search or API endpoints
    * we can provide custom search and/or API access to the content of the Semantic Background

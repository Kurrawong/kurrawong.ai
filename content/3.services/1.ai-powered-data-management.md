# AI-Powered Data Management

![](/img/ai-dm.svg)

We have been implementing data management solutions for organisations for many years, and we also work extensively with AI. 

We now use AI tools within data management projects to:

* convert data into standard formats
* extract and enhance metadata
* make catalogue indexes, including auto-tagging with themes
* provide natural-language content searching

Our [KaiFrame](/products/kaiframe) product is our multi-part AI tool system which we customise and deploy to organisations to help them make sense of legacy data and documents.

We use natural language processing and machine learning within the [annif tool](https://annif.org]) to classify textual resources according to reference [vocabnularies](/services/vocabularies) so we can catalogue records with enhanced categorisation whihc helps browsing by theme.

We also use [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) to provide natural language searching across large collections of documents.

Around KaiFrame, we provide consulting on all aspects of data management such as:

* creating and using reference data
* cataloguing primary data
* [creating data models](/services/data-modelling)
* implementing [data governance](/services/data-governance).

We are also able to provide [training](/services/training) on any aspect of systems we implement, and we are also able to [support](/services/support) anything we have built or implemented too.

With all of these services, we aim to provide a total data management service, backed by AI tech.

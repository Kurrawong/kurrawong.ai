# Support

We support systems that we build for clients and also a number of open source our own and 3rd party proprietary products used either in our systems or in isolation. We are always willing to establish custom Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for clients. 

* [Service Areas](#service-areas)
* [Service Level Agreements](#service-level-agreements)
* [Case Study: BDR](#case-study-bdr)
* [Tool Support](#tool-support)


## Service Areas
Our staff have deep data systems, data governance, IT infrastructure and specialist systems experience and we use this as the basis for our SLAs. We already offer SLAs in the areas of:

* Knowledge Graph systems
* data catalogues
* generic cloud data systems
* AI systems 
* Data Lakes
* specialist reference data, vocabularies and Semantic Web management tools

Due to the custom, project-based, nature our work and the cutting edge technology we employ, we are always looking to deliver new SLAs for new things. If we built it, we will be able to support it!

### Support Plans
For systems with high exposure, where urgent reporting or remediation of issues is a priority, we can offer a Support Plan. This gives you the ability to lodge an issue with us at any time, and our team will treat it with priority. Upon completion of our triage process, you will be provided with an estimate for remediation work necessary, and any further hours spent are only upon appropriate authorisation from your organisation.

This solution provides you with prioritised response times in a pay-as-you-go approach, however, you may also choose to establish pre-approval for immediate remediation for issues of particular types.

We are happy to supply new clients with example/previous support plans to build on.

### Ongoing Maintenance Arrangements
For systems expecting enhancement and ongoing feature development, we are happy to establish ongoing maintenance arrangements. Typically, we provide an agreed hours availability with the ability for your organisation to remain involved in backlog planning and prioritisation of work.

### Ad-hoc Support Solutions
If you have an issue with your existing system we have built or worked on that would benefit from our services, we can offer time and materials based Support for small one-off solutions.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
For the Australian national [Biodiversity Data Repository (BDR)](https://bdr.gov.au/), KurrawongAI initially provided a number of possible Solution Architecture to the [Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment & Water (DCCEEW)](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/). 

From there, three particular Knowledge Graph DB systems were selected for testing by loading in the BDR's large data holdings and monitoring query performance.

One product was chosen for initial use and deployed within an architecture to a particular public cloud. After a change in policy at DCCEEW, the architecture was moved to a different public cloud and partially rebuilt: same DB product, same APIs but different networking components and infracode scripting.

This entire system that now meets DCCEEW architectural patterns and security requirements will be handed over to DCCEEW for long-term operations by KurrawongAI in 2025.

## Tool Support

We use, know well, support and extend a number of self-developed and 3rd party, open source tools, mostly related to Knowledge Graphs. We provide consulting and support for:

* **data transformation**: us using these tools on your data
* **tool training**: helping you to use these tools 
* **tool extension**: further developing existing tools to do new things
* **security maintenance**: ensuring open source tools are secure and up-to-date

![Annif logo](/img/annif.png){style="width:150px; float:right; clear:right;"}

### Data Manipulation

The main data manipulation tools we work with are:

1. [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib), the open source Python RDF manipulation toolkit
2. [Apache Jena](https://jena.apache.org/), a Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications
3. [annif](https://annif.org), an open source natural language processing and machine learning content auto-tagger

We ue these tools to "uplift" legacy data into Knowledge Graph form and to create new data.

KurrawongAI staff currently lead the maintenance of RDFLib and are active participants in the Jena community too.

### Data Storage

We use many database systems for our work and anything we work on we can support you in using too. The main databases we know and use are:

4. [GraphDB](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/) - a cutting-edge commercial KG DB
5. [Jena's Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) - a leading open-source Knowledge Graph DB

### Data Delivery

![Olis logo.](/img/logo-olis.png){style="float:right; width:100px;clear:right;"}
![Prez logo](/img/logo-prez.png){style="float:right; width:100px;"}

We make data available via a number of standard and custom APIs, in particular:

6. [Prez](/products/prez) - a versatile Linked Data API
7. [Olis](/products/olis) - our Knowledge Graph access control API

### Cloud Architectures

Most of our own and client systems are Cloud Computing platforms and we work with almost all the major vendors: Microsoft Azure, AWS, OpenStack...

We use and develop cor clients multi-part cloud architectures using infracode systems such as:

8. [Bicep](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview?tabs=bicep)
9. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)
10. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
11. [Podman](https://podman.io/)

We can deploy any work we do using any of these or similar tools that meet with your required architectural patterns.

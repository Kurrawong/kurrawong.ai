# AI Appropriateness

## Service Offering

KurrawongAI has implemented quite a few AI systems that use different tools, for different clients and at different scales. We provide Business Analytics-style consulting specifically for AI appropriateness to help you consider if and how AI is sensible for your organisation.

Some of the things we help you consider are:

-   What data sources do you want in scope?
-   Is there an overarching conceptual or information model?
-   What are some competency questions the system must answer?
-   What kinds of UI do you want?
-   How and where do you want an AI system to run?

We suggest you consider these questions _before_ undertaking a larger AI project, since there are many AI options out there.

Our Business Analytics, AI and Data Modelling staff can work with your staff to proceed through the above questions which providing insights into procedural and technology choices, backed-up by our experience on previous projects.

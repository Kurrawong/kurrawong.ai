# Support

We support systems that we build for clients and also a number of open source our own and 3rd party proprietary products used either in our systems or in isolation. We are always willing to establish custom Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for clients. 

## Service Offering

Our staff have deep data systems, data governance, IT infrastructure and specialist systems experience and we use this as the basis for our SLAs. We already offer SLAs in the areas of:

* Knowledge Graph systems
* generic cloud data systems
* AI systems 
* Data Lakes
* specialist vocabulary and Semantic Web management tools

Due to the custom project-based nature of what we work on and the cutting edge technology we employ, we are always looking to deliver new SLAs for new things. If we built it, we will be able to support it!

### Support Plans
Best for systems with high exposure, where urgent reporting or remediation of issues is a priority, we can offer a Support Plan. This gives you the ability to lodge an issue with us at any time, and our team will treat it with priority status. Upon completion of our triage process, you will be provided with an estimate for remediation work necessary, and any further hours spent are only upon appropriate authorisation from your organisation.

This solution provides you with prioritised response times in a pay-as-you-go approach, however, you may also choose to establish pre-approval for immediate remediation for issues of a particular type.

We are happy to supply new clients with example/previous support plans to build on.

### Ongoing Maintenance Arrangements
For systems expecting enhancement and ongoing feature development, we are happy to establish ongoing maintenance arrangements. Typically, we provide an agreed hours availability with the ability for your organisation to remain involved in backlog planning and prioritisation of work.


### Ad-hoc Support Solutions
If you have an issue with your existing system we have built or worked on that would benefit from our services, we can offer time and materials based Support for small one-off solutions.

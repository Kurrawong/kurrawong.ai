## Service Offering

At KurrawongAI, we believe in providing services that can meet the requirements of your organisation, its data, and its technology into the future. As such, we offer our teams expertise and knowledge to the support of existing Knowledge Graph Systems so that they can adapt with your needs.

KurrawongAI can offer Support for Knowledge Graph Systems that we have designed and implemented, or those that utilise our preferred [Products](/products). Our support services will generally fit within one of the below areas:

### Support Plans
Best for systems with high exposure, where urgent reporting or remediation of issues is a priority, KurrawongAI can also offer a Support Plan. This gives your authorised users the ability to lodge an issue with us at any time, and our team will treat it with priority status. Upon completion of our triage process, you will be povided with an estimate for remediation work necessary, and any further hours spent are only upon appropriate authorisation from your organisation.

This solution provides you with prioritised response times in a pay-as-you-go approach, however, you may choose to establish pre-approval for immediate remediation for issues of a particular type.

### Ongoing Maintenance Arrangements
Particularly for systems with expected enhancement requirements and ongoing feature development, it may be beneficial to establish an ongoing maintenance arrangement. This provides an agreed hours availability (6 month min. period), with the ability for your organisation to remain involved in backlog planning and prioritisation of work.

While resource availability does not include agreed response times, there is the option to request bug or issue prioritisation where remaining hours and effort are available within the agreed period. This provides your organisation with a fixed cost access to continuing support.

### Ad-hoc Support Solutions
If you have an issue with your existing Knowledge Graph Systems that would benefit from our expert services, we may be able to offer time and materials based Support for small one-off solutions.

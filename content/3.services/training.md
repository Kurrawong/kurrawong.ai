## Established Courses

We have a range of established training courses that can be delivered either in-person or via videoconference, and in either case with the use of interactive [Jupyter Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter) by the presenter and recipients to test out concepts and techniques. 

Some of our training modules are also available online for self-directed learning and are free to access at anytime via the links below. 

The training courses we currently offer are:

## Customised Training

Our training courses have been built up for clients based on their required staff capabilities. 

We are happy to build up new training material for new projects and/or to generate new stand-alone courses - [contact us](/contact) to find out more.

Some of the courses we are considering creating are:

1. Semantic Web Data Modelling
2. Configuring [Prez](/products/prez)
3. Data Management Status Self-Assessment
4. Indigenous Data: discovery, description & management
5. Persistent Identifiers - all you need to know

## Costs

### Established Courses

For Established Courses, the costs are `Hourly Rate x Course Length x 3`, so for the first 2 modules of the SPARQL course - a total of 5 hours - it would be `Hourly Rate x 15`. This lets us arrange the where and when of the course, prepare for course delivery, customise some content, deliver it to you and supply ongoing training material.

Costs are fixed, regardless of the number of people undertaking the course, but if training is just for 1 person, we can make simpler arrangements.

### Customised Training

We can establish courses as part of our normal project work, but you can also ask us to create new courses, in which case we will just quote expected time as a mini project.

# Vocabularies

## Service Offering

KurrawongAI has extensive experience in creating controlled vocabularies for organisations to use as master data - referenced by other data products and systems.

We usually use Knowledge Graph methods and the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) vocabulary data model but are also familiar with many other models and systems.

Many of our vocabulary system establishment projects see us creating vocabularies for clients and then training them to create their own and to govern them (see [Data Governance](/services/data-governance)).

We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them into Knowledge Graph (SKOS) vocabularies.

We also then created 5 other vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the [VocPub](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub) vocabulary data model to publish these vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally, we established a [Prez](/products/prez) instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

The system is production online at <https://vocabularies.sarig.sa.gov.au/vocab>.

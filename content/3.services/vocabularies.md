# Vocabularies

## Service Offering

KurrawongAI has extensive experience in creating Knowledge Graph ([SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/))-based vocabularies, also known as taxonomies, to classify data and objects with.

Many of our vocabulary system establishment projects see us creating vocabularies for clients and then training them to create their own and to govern them (see [Data Governance](/services/data-governance)).

::KCaseStudy{logo}
We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them into SKOS vocabularies.

We also then created 5 other SKOS vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the [VocPub](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub) Profile's vocabulary metadata to publish these 11 vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally we established a [Prez](/products/prez) instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

Use is on-going.

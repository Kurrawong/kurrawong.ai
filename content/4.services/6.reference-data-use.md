# Reference Data

![](/img/ref-data.svg)

KurrawongAI often builds systems that rely on reference data - vocabularies, models, background spatial data layers - to classify and provide organised access to information.

We have [specialised offerings for the creation, management and use of vocabularies](/services/vocabularies), but we go beyond that and support all kinds of reference data use. 

Some of the things you may consider when organising your data that have reference data solutions:

* **How do I align different datasets?**
    * by using reference models for common patterns within each
* **How do I order collections of documents?**
    * by classifying them according to theme vocabularies
* **How do I provide spatial and themed summaries of my data?**
    * by using reference spatial layers and classification terms

# Vocabularies

KurrawongAI has extensive experience in creating controlled vocabularies for organisations to use as master data - referenced by other data products and systems.

We usually use Knowledge Graph methods and the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) vocabulary data model but are also familiar with many other models and systems.

For many projects we create vocabularies for clients, publish them via systems and then train the client them to create, govern and publish them, themselves.

::KCaseStudy{logo}
We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them into Knowledge Graph (SKOS) vocabularies.

We also then created 5 other vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the [VocPub](https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub) vocabulary data model to publish these vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally, we established a [Prez](/products/prez) instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

The system is production online at <https://vocabularies.sarig.sa.gov.au/vocab>.

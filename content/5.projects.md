These are some of KurrawongAI's recent projects:

---

### Vocabulary system establishment for South Australia's Department for Energy and Mining

_This is an example of a common government vocabulary establishment project._

We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them into SKOS vocabularies.

We also then created 5 other SKOS vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the <a href="https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub">VocPub</a> Profile's vocabulary metadata to publish these 11 vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally we established a <a href="/products/prez">Prez</a> instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

Use is ongoing and we continue to work on vocabulary and external system integration.

### Biodiversity Data Repository (BDR)

KurrawongAI developed a robust, scalable and secure national data system for managing species observations for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW), comprising millions of records and data sets from across government jurisdictions as well as the private sector. The [BDR](https://bdr.gov.au/) improves accessibility to Australia's biodiversity data, providing a range of benefits to government, industry and the community including supporting critical environmental functions, improving regulatory processes, and enabling advanced scientific research.  

The system is a graph-native database that implements the national graph data model ABIS, which was partially designed by KurrawongAI staff. The software used is GraphDB for data storage and other infrastructure elements, running in an Azure Cloud environment.

This project required a full-service solution for DCCEEW from database technology evaluation, recommendation & test implementations; solutions architecture design; infracode scripting; container management; and custom API creation, through to system hosting services and ongoing system support in line with a Service Level Agreement.

### National Candidate Address Model

This project developed a candidate national address model for Australia and New Zealand, based on the [ANZ ICSM Address Strategy 2035](https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035-strategy).

The model is an OWL model and it has been test implemented in both RDF and non-RDF (relational) systems.

- [Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html) within which the Address Model fits.

### Queensland Spatial Information Dataset Redesign

KurrawongAI completed modelling of the Address and Place Names datasets of Queensland and their relationships to Cadastral information via a [FrontierSI](https://frontiersi.com.au/) consortium with the following, outputs:

- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html)
  - overarching framework linking the Address & Place Names models to Cadastral data
- [Candidate National Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
  - aligns with ICSM Addressing 2035 strategy, national & international models
  - provides graph and relational DB implementations of Qld testing data
  - used by the Linked Data version of the G-NAF soon to be online via a [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au/) Foundational Spatial Data Framework initiative
- [QSI Place Names Model](https://w3id.org/profile/qsi-placenames)
  - A profile of the ANZ National Address Model and the Place Names Ontology for the representation of Place Names in Queensland

### Direct Consulting

KurrawongAI staff are currently working on several projects that require direct consulting about Knowledge Graph systems and know-how to clients. These are often internal projects and can't be listed here! Call us for details...

# Projects

These are some of KurrawongAI's recent projects:


### TERN Triplestore Scaling

The [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)](https://www.tern.org.au) measures terrestrial ecosystem attributes over time from continental scale to field sites at hundreds of locations throughout Australia and provides open, model-ready data that enables researchers to detect and interpret changes in land ecosystems.

This project aims to prove that a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) can be used for TERN's central scientific data holdings which are already in [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) form but are currently not housed in one system.

### Vocabulary system establishment for South Australia's Department for Energy and Mining

_This is an example of a common government vocabulary establishment project._

We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them into SKOS vocabularies.

We also then created 5 other SKOS vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the <a href="https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub">VocPub</a> Profile's vocabulary metadata to publish these 11 vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally we established a <a href="/products/prez">Prez</a> instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

Use is ongoing and we continue to work on vocabulary and external system integration.

### National Candidate Address Model

This project developed a candidate national address model for Australia and New Zealand, based on the [ANZ ICSM Address Strategy 2035](https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035-strategy).

The model is an OWL model and it has been test implemented in both RDF and non-RDF (relational) systems.

- [Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html) within which the Address Model fits.

### Queensland Spatial Information Dataset Redesign

KurrawongAI has recently (June, 2022) completed modelling the Address and Place Names datasets of Queensland and their relationships to Cadastral information via a [FrontierSI](https://frontiersi.com.au/) consortium with the following, outputs:

- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html)
  - overarching framework linking the Address & Place Names models to Cadastral data
- [Candidate National Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
  - aligns with ICSM Addressing 2035 strategy, national & international models
  - provides graph and relational DB implementations of Qld testing data
  - used by the Linked Data version of the G-NAF soon to be online via a [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au/) Foundational Spatial Data Framework initiative
- [QSI Place Names Model](https://w3id.org/profile/qsi-placenames)
  - A profile of the ANZ National Address Model and the Place Names Ontology for the representation of Place Names in Queensland

### Semantic Web system scaling consulting

KurrawongAI will provide an analysis of the Semantic Web system's used by the [Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network (TERN)](https://www.tern.org.au/) to ensure they can scale to meet growing data and usage demands over July/September, 2022.

TERN are perhaps the most "Semantic Web native" government/educational unit in Australia and to work with them is an honour.

### Direct Consulting

KurrawongAI staff are currently working on several projects that require direct consulting about Knowledge Graph systems and know-how to clients. These are often internal projects and can't be listed here! Call us for details...

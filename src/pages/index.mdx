### About us

KurrawongAI is a small, Australian-based company enabling organisations to take control of their data.

We use data modelling, data governance and data systems implementation expertise all based on [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) and [Knowledge Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) principles to ensure data is in the richest, most open and most extensible form it can be.

We use knowledge graphs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as for [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and Artifcial Intelligence applications.

### Availability

KurrawongAI can be contracted directly and is on several government panels, please get in touch to make arrangements.

Kurrawong AI uses [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) to make data suitable for Artificial Intelligence applications. We are incorporated in Australia but work globally.

We use KGs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

We model data using the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) so itâ€™s in the richest, most open and most extensible form data can be.

## Current work

### Queensland Spatial Information Dataset Redesign

Kurrawong AI has recently (June, 2022) completed modelling the Address and Place Names datasets of Queensland and their relationships to Cadastral information via a [FrontierSI](https://frontiersi.com.au/) consortium with the following, outputs:

- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html)
  - overarching framework linking the Address & Place Names models to Cadastral data
- [Candidate National Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
  - aligns with ICSM Addressing 2035 strategy, national & international models
  - provides graph and relational DB implementations of Qld testing data
  - used by the Linked Data version of the G-NAF soon to be online via a [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au/) Foundational Spatial Data Framework initiative
- [QSI Place Names Model](https://w3id.org/profile/qsi-placenames)
  - A profile of the ANZ National Address Model and the Place Names Ontology for the representation of Place Names in Queensland

### Semantic Web system scaling consulting

Kurrawong AI will provide an analysis of the Semantic Web system's used by the [Terrestrial Ecosystems Research Network (TERN)](https://www.tern.org.au/) to ensure they can scale to meet growing data and usage demands over July/September, 2022.

TERN are perhaps the most "Semantic Web native" government/educational unit in Australia and to work with them is an honour.

[Prez](https://github.com/rdflib/prez/), at v2, is an existing, open source, API tool. Prez presents slices of Knowledge Graphs according defined _profiles_ and implements the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) protocol [Content Negotiation by Profile (ConnegP)](https://w3c.github.io/dx-connegp/connegp/).

Prez is commonly used to deliver [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) vocabularies online and [GeoSPARQL](https://opengeospatial.github.io/ogc-geosparql/geosparql11/spec.html) spatial semantic data.

Existing production instances are:

- [Geological Survey of Queensland's Vocabularies](https://vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/)
- [Australian Statistical Geographies Standard spatial feature collections](https://asgs.linked.fsdf.org.au/dataset/asgsed3/collections)
  - example object, an 'SA3' area: [Hobart - North East](https://asgs.linked.fsdf.org.au/dataset/asgsed3/collections/SA3/items/60102)

Prez v3 is the next generation of the Prez tool which is still open source but with many enhancements:

- separate API and UI
- increased performance
- data-configurable profiles

Prez v3 is being developed by KurrawongAI and also collaborators, in particular, the [Indigenous Data Network](https://mspgh.unimelb.edu.au/centres-institutes/centre-for-health-equity/research-group/indigenous-data-network) who will be using Prez v3 to provide ongoing access to their complex Knowledge Graph (see our [Projects Page](/projects) for more info).

### Availability

KurrawongAI offers commercial support for Prez v3. _See our [Prez Supported Product Page](/supported-products/prez)._

### Costs

Prez v3 installations are costed based on the effort required for system establishment and, optionally, data creation. Typically, this involves

  <p>
    Olis is a graph management application. Its job is to help administrators of
    Knowledge Graphs manage them as a number of parts that can be remixes for
    different content access by different users.
  </p>
  <p>
    Olis - "Silo", reversed! - as the idea with Olis is that you have the
    opposite of a Data Silo: well-managed Knowledge Graphs provide the most
    accessible form of data: it is system-independent and <em>well-defined</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>
      KurrawongAI will offer commercial support for Olis system establishment
      and maintenance after the first production deployment which is expected in
      April 2023. See our <a href="/services">Services Page</a>.

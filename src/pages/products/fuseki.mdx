[Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/) is an [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/) free and open source product that is part of the [Jena](https://jena.apache.org/) RDF framework.

It is a database system that implements the [SPARQL Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-protocol/) which means you can run Fuseki to expose RDF data.

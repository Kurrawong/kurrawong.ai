## Current

### TERN Triplestore Scaling

The [Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN)](https://www.tern.org.au) is a measures terrestrial ecosystem attributes over time from continental scale to field sites at hundreds of locations throughout Australia and provide open, model-ready data that enables researchers to detect and interpret changes in land ecosystems.

This project aims to prove that a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore) can be used for TERN's central scientific data holdings which are already in [Web Ontology Language (OWL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) form but are currently not housed in one system.

### Vocabulary system establishment for South Australia's Department for Energy and Mining

_This is an example of a common government vocabulary establishment project._

We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms created by the Department and converted them to SKOS vocabularies.

We also then creates 5 other SKOS vocabularies ourselves: several based on external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.

We then created an extension of the <a href="https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub">VocPub</a> Profile's vocabulary metadata to publish these 11 vocabularies with extended derivation and governance information.

Finally we established a <a href="/supported-products/prez">Prez</a> instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and cataloguing systems.

Use is ongoing and we continue to work on vocabulary and external system integration.

## Recent

### National Candidate Address Model

This project developed a candidate national address model for Australia and New Zealand, based on the [ANZ ICSM Address Strategy 2035](https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035-strategy).

The model is an OWL model and it has been test implemented in both RDF and non-RDF (relational) systems.

- [Address Model](https://nicholascar.com/anz-nat-addr-model-candidate/model.html)
- [Queensland Spatial Information Supermodel](https://nicholascar.com/qsi-supermodel/supermodel.html) within which the Address Model fits.

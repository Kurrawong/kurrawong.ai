# Data Modelling

## Service Offering

KurrawongAI is extremely experienced with the creation and implementation of Knowledge Graphs, including [OWL](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-primer/) / Semantic Web data modelling.

  <h3>Case Study</h3>
  <h4>Address Model for ANZ</h4>
  <p>
    <em>This is an example of an OWL modelling and implementation project.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    KurrawongAI responded to a request to implement a new Addresses data model
    for the Queensland government that catered for future address data
    requirements, as specified in the <a href="https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications/addressing-2035">
        ICSM Addressing 2035 strategy</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2022 we produced an OWL model of address information derived from the
    <a href="https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-19432f89-dc3a-4ef3-b943-5326ef1dbecc">Geocoded National Address file relational model</a>
and an OWL version of the <a href="https://linked.data.gov.au/def/iso19160-1-address">
      ISO 19160 international address model</a> that KurrawongAI staff developed during 2017 while at CSIRO.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implemented example data for this model within a Knowledge Graph system (<a href="/products/fuseki">Fuseki</a>) and also a relational system (Postgres) to demonstrate the models competence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The work was well received by the client - the <a href="https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/">Queensland Department of Resources</a>
    as evidenced by follow-on Solutions Architecture work in 2023 that designs the systems needed to implement this model in production.

We offer the following Knowledge Graph data modelling services:

- **domain-specific data modelling**
  - we've modelled in many domains, such as archiving, environmental science, spatial data and data provenance
  - we are able to pair up with your domain experts and develop models with them
- **enterprise data modelling**
  - so-called "Supermodel" modelling whereby we model a broad scenario's requirements as a data model
  - Supermodels are compartmentalised allowing for staged implementation
- **model skill demonstration**
  - query-based competency testing of models
  - demonstrate the power of Knowledge Graph models
- **example data generation**
  - we can hand-make data to assist with model demonstration for specific scenarios
- **data transform**
  - from existing systems to new Knowledge Graph models
  - see more about our Knowledge Graph [Tools](/services/tools) service offering

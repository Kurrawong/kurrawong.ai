# Vocabularies

## Service Offering

KurrawongAI has extensive experience in creating Knowledge Graph ([SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/))-based vocabularies, also known as taxonomies, to classify data and objects with.

Many of our vocabulary system establishment projects see us creating vocabularies for clients and then training them to create their own and to govern them (see [Data Governance](/services/data-governance)).

  <h3>Case Study</h3>
  <h4>
    Vocabulary system establishment for South Australia's Department for Energy
    and Mining
  </h4>
  <p>
    <em>
      This is an example of a common government vocabulary establishment
      project.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    We took Excel spreadsheets of 6 vocabularies of dataset classification terms
    created by the Department and converted them into SKOS vocabularies.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also then created 5 other SKOS vocabularies ourselves: several based on
    external vocabularies, one or two from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    We then created an extension of the{" "}
    <a href="https://w3id.org/profile/vocpub">VocPub</a> Profile's vocabulary
    metadata to publish these 11 vocabularies with extended derivation and
    governance information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally we established a <a href="/supported-products/prez">Prez</a>{" "}
    instance, branded for the Department, that published their vocabularies in
    both human- and machine-readable form for use by their staff, industry and
    cataloguing systems.
  </p>
  <p>Use is on-going.</p>

## Supported Product

[Prez](https://github.com/rdflib/prez/) is an open source, data-configurable, Linked Data API framework that delivers _profiles_ of Knowledge Graph data according to the Content Negotiation by Profile standard.

We use Prez to deliver thematic views of data stored in Knowledge Graphs, for example, for the [Geological Survey of Queensland](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/resources/geoscience-information/gsq), we support an instance of Prez configured to deliver business and scientific _vocabularies_, that is controlled lists of terms available in human- and machine-readable form.

  <h3>Case Study</h3>
  <h4>Prez for the Geological Survey of Queensland</h4>
  <p>
    <em>This is an how we deploy Prez for organisations.</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    We deployed Prez for GSQ in 2019 to present a small number of scientific
    vocabularies that they were developing, such as
    <a href="http://linked.data.gov.au/def/sample-preparation-methods">
      Sample Preparation Methods.
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding Prez easy to use, GSQ then characterised some business vocabs, such
    as
    <a href="https://vocabs.gsq.digital/object?uri=http://linked.data.gov.au/def/transaction-status">
      Transaction Status
    </a>
    and presented then via Prez too.
  </p>
  <p>
    GSQ continues to use Prez (see
    <a href="https://vocabs.gsq.digital/vocabulary/">all their vocabs</a>) and are
    currently establishing a reference spatial dataset - the
    <em>Geological Features of Queensland</em> which they will soon deliver as
    spatial data via Prez also.
  </p>
  <p>
    For GSQ, Prez is easy to use, long-term reliable, and easily expandable for
    more classes of data.

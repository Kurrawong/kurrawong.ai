## Supported Product

RDFTools is KurrawongAI's own online RDF conversion & validation tool based on [RDFLib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) and [pySHACL](https://pypi.org/project/pyshacl/).

You can see and use RDFTools for free online at:

- http://rdftools.kurrawong.net

We produce the following services for RDFTools:

- **own instance**
  - we can establish a differently-branded clone of RDFTools for your organisation, loaded with your specific validators
  - we have done this for [Geoscience Australia](https://www.ga.gov.au) so that their staff and community can validate their RDF data with a fixed set of provided validators
